Recursion is a powerful technique used to solve various problems in computer science and mathematics. Some common problems that can be elegantly solved using recursion include:

Factorial Calculation: Finding the factorial of a non-negative integer.
Fibonacci Sequence: Generating the nth Fibonacci number.
Binary Search: Searching for an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer.
Tree Traversal: Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of binary trees.
Merge Sort: Sorting an array using the divide and conquer approach.
Towers of Hanoi: Moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, using a spare peg, adhering to specific rules.
Permutations and Combinations: Generating all permutations or combinations of a set of elements.
Maze Solving: Finding a path from the start to the end of a maze.
Generating Subsets: Generating all possible subsets of a set.
Palindrome Checking: Checking whether a given string is a palindrome.
